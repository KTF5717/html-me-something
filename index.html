            <p>An unfortunate ACL tear in high school left me unable to continue playing soccer
                for the remainder of high school. Therefore, I was not healed in time to be
                scouted for colleges, and life had to go on without my favorite sport.</p>

            <p>In my first semester of college, I was introduced to League of Legends by the friends
                I made in the dorms. We were all trying to pass each other in rank, and I quickly
                discovered that League provided the competitive outlet that I lacked without soccer.
                After one season of play, I achieved diamond rank for the first time.</p>

            <p>Playing League since the end of 2013, I have made so many friends along the way who
                have all been immensely impactful in my life. After 5+ years of friendship, we all finally
                met for the first time at the beginning of this year, for LCS Spring finals at Chaifetz Arena.
